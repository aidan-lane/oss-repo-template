# Lab 04 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

Some key take-aways from this reading are the the list of core factors of what is means for a project to be truly open source. This includes things such as allowing users to run code how they wish, edit code, and copy-left. All of these properties of open-source software ensure that the project is not abused by malactors and is equal-opportunity for all who wish to use it.

It's important to choose a license so that your software is not abused. It gives those who wish to use it a list of rules they must follow that are in the best interest of both the developer(s) and the open source community. In addition, it gives legal protection in the case of user mal-use.

**4.**\
You shouldn't use an open-source project that doesn't have an explicit license for legal reasons. A license legally protects both the developer and the user. If there is no license than the user has to basis as to how they can use the software (such as modifying it for commercial use).

**5.**\
I do with the claim in this article which argues that the Gopher team used the "right thing" approach which hindered its development. This is because by taking this approach, they restricted the number of interest developers. As we have learned, open source mostly benefits from having a wide, diverse group of programmers give their input and edits on a given project. Relying on a core team of developers is more similar to proprietary software and can delay process.

**6.**\
Android chose Apache for as its core license due to its less restrictive properties as opposed to a license such as LGPL/GPL. As stated on their source website, a LGPL license requires the shipping of source to the application which in an open source application setting, can restrict device designs. Apache allows for developers to modify it without concern for royalties, and is not copy-left too which is an added benefit.

In contrast, the kernel for Android uses GPLv2 which is more restrictive. This is because the kernel is the underyling basis of Android and can only be released under the same license.
